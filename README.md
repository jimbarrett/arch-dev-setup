# Arch Development Setup

## Installation:

```
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimbarrett/arch-dev-setup/main/arch-dev-setup.sh
sh arch-dev-setup.sh
```

This will set up a full arch environment with most of the tools that I use everyday. 
Much of the code behind this was pulled directly from [LARBS](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS),
and in most situations you may be better off looking there first.
